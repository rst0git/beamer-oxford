Work out why there's a <1px gap between sidebar and footer

Medium term
    * Write guide on setting up foundry sterling (requiring xelatex for now)
    * Write install instructions
    * Make font lookup work without xelatex
        plus oxmathletter style option for which is going to be used
            this may be improvable


Longer term
    * Package properly to support system-wide installation
